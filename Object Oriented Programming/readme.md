## Object Oriented Programming Project

* A standalone application (offline) which can help fresh graduates to get job or internship, it can also create a resume (in *pdf* format) for student users. Companies can use this application to see profiles of various applicants (from different fields categorized into four potential areas: academics, engineering, medical field, Commercial stuff) (Companies can filter through all profiles by selecting a specific field) to find best candidate available for the job.

* I did this project in second semester  (newbie :) . *JAVA* language was used for the implementation. Focus of this project was to apply core aspects of *Object Oriented Programming* (like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, etc) and also to *apply various java concepts* (objects, classes, abstract classes, interfaces, packaging, file handling, etc), which were learnt throughout the course. 

* Whole project was structured in MVC (Model View Controller) manner. All the UI elements in *view* package, all button listeners in *controller* package and entity classes in *model* package. And further categorizing them into different packages depending on various entities involved.

* To run this project, import this folder in [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), add external jars from *jars/* directory to project and execute. Sample resume file generated from this application is also attached here, take a look at *Resume.pdf*
